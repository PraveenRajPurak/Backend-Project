# There is no better way to learn dev than making projects

I am going to build a complex professional grade backend project by following backend series of Hitesh Sir - Chai aur Code YT.

All controllers and routes are completed. I will add some more miscellaneous controllers to make the backend more strengthened.

So, I mark this project as complete with scope of improvement.

# update

A new controller has been added to the set of video controllers. It is called "getAllVideos" and it extracts details of videos that matches the sorting query as well as the search query.
