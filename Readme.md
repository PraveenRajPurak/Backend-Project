# There is no better way to learn dev than making projects

I am going to build a complex professional grade backend project by following backend series of Hitesh Sir - Chai aur Code YT.

All controllers and routes are completed. I will add some more miscellaneous controllers to make the backend more strengthened.

So, I mark this project as complete with scope of improvement.
